 Volcanic eruptions cause significant loss of lives and property around the world
each year. Their importance is highlighted by the sheer number of volcanoes for which eruptive
activity is probable. These volcanoes are classified as in a state of unrest. The Global
Volcano Project maintained by the Smithsonian Institution estimates that approximately 600
volcanoes, many proximal to major urban areas, are currently in this state of unrest. A spectrum
of phenomena serve as precursors to eruption, including ground deformation, emission
of gases, and seismic activity. The precursors are caused by magma upwelling from the Moho
to the shallow (2-5 km) subsurface and magma movement in the volcano conduit immediately
preceding eruption.
Precursors have in common the fundamental petrologic processes of melt generation in the
lithosphere and subsequent magma differentiation. Our ultimate objective is to apply state of-the-art
machine learning techniques to volcano eruption forecasting. We
will be applying machine learning techniques to the precursor data, such as the 1999 eruption of
Redoubt volcano, Alaska, for which a comprehensive record of precursor activity exists as
USGS public domain files and global data bases, such as the Smithsonian Institution Global
Volcanology Project and Aerocom (which is part of the HEMCO data base). As a result, we can hope to
get geophysically meaningful results
